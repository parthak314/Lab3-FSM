## Task 0 - Setup GTest
GTest, or Google Test, is a C++ testing framework that facilitates unit testing with features like test case creation and assertions. 
It supports test fixtures for setup and teardown processes and integrates well with build systems and includes Google Mock for creating mock objects.

Installed using:
```bash
sudo apt install libgtest-dev
```

Then creating a test case for multiplying two numbers as:
```c++
int multiply(int a, int b) { return a * b; }
```

This is now passed after running the test and reaches the expected value of 15 for 3 * 5.
